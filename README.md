# ETL_CRASH
 Team "CRASH" ETL Project

 ETL_CRASH is an in-class Data Analytics Project wherein this team is tasked with creating a new database on any subject from existing worldwide web resources. The subjectmatter we chose is comparative financial data. Collecting financial data surrounding the Great Recession, and pairing it with same categories' data from 3-years prior to present day, we hope to create an efficient and compact database for use in comparative analysis of the two periods.

 ETL is the data science acronymn for Extract - Transform - Load ("data-13-1-extract-transform-load.pptx"), the process in which data integration into a database is accomplished: 
 1) Extracting data subsets from various resouces including API's, webforms, webscraping, existing databases, and spreadsheets or tables.
 2) Transforming each subset such that it is internally consistent in format, syntax, structure; and externally consistent with other data subsets to be included in the final integration. 
 3) Loading the data subsets into a database. Depending on the relational vs. non-relational structure of the new database, this step includes database design (and relations).

The earlier grouping of data is from two years prior to the fall of Lehman Brothers, September 15, 2008, to one year after same. The later grouping of data is three years prior to present day. By assembling various data sources in this single resource we are creating a compact resource that can be efficiently accessed for comparative study. 

We decided to use Mongodb as the database framework.....
